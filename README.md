The impact of bookable loading bays on stress levels of freight drivers

This site contains the code used for processing physiological and GPS data in the project "Drivers Welfare". 

This study examines how kerbside digitalization affects stress scores among freight delivery crews in urban settings. Stress was assessed using self-reports and physiological indicators, including electrodermal activity, pulse rate, and skin temperature, before and after the introduction of bookable loading bays. Data from 17 monitored trips in Londonâ€™s Borough Market area provided insights into stress triggers, particularly related to searching for parking and loading bay availability. The findings motivated reflections about the potential of digital solutions to address driver working conditions, traffic safety, and conflicts over access to kerbside space.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13600f12-c190-44da-8c11-90bf04110dba)
